- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an old, chunky toshiba that originally ran on windows 7, but
  then my Dad decided to update it to 8.1, so that he could pirate movies better for us (he used uTorrent).
  On my N/A...th birthday, I used it for a bit, pirated some stuff. then forgot about it. A couple years go by
  and I yet again discover this fucked up janky ass screw-through-the-back-left-corner-to-keep-both-halves-together
  piece of history, and updated it to windows 10 (Because for fun). Funniy enough it ran not shit! :)
  And it could run games decently! Anyways its on ubuntu since last week (ish) because
  Toshiba ended support and practically shut down my laptop.

	i also like emulators i guess
